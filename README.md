# Diabetes_Prediction_Using_Logistic-Regression_SVM_ANN_CNN


In this project we try to predict about a person whether he is diabetic or not diabetic with the paramenters in the csv file.

We try to execute 2 machine learnig models and 2 deep learning models. 

Machine Learning Models include:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Support Vector Machine

Deep learning Models
1. Artificial Neural Network
2. Convolution Neural Network
